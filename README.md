# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Stats preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

After studying CSS and HTML a little bit and how FlexBox works, I tried to do another challenge!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

The desktop version looks like this:

## My process

First I understood the divs and the "box" in the site, and then tried to locate each positon, it was a little bit tough but I got it!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project I learned even more about CSS and FlexBox. 

### Continued development

I will try a couple more challenges in [Frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) and then start learning React!
